ðŸ‘‹ Hi there - I'm CJ.

You'll mostly find me writing code for amateur radio based applications. I no longer do it professionally. I also spend my free time hunting for countries on HF radio, and playing Old School Runescape. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on too many projects...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for a bachelors in Electrical Engineering.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about RF and amateur radio applications for programming!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: post on one of my repositories here (this one works!)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can decode morse code in my head!
