ðŸ‘‹ Hi there - I'm CJ.

You'll mostly find me writing code for amateur radio based applications. I no longer do it professionally.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [dx-logger](https://github.com/cjtheham/dx-logger) - a web-based amateur radio QSO logging platform.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying for a bachelor's in electrical engineering.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking to collaborate on [horace](https://github.com/knights-of-academia/horace) and other Knights of Academia projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about RF communcations and amateur radio!
- ðŸ“« Find me on Twitter: @ww0_cj, or somewhere in the ham radio Discord space.
